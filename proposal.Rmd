# Tentative Project Title

Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Behavioral and Demographic Factors

# Motivation

Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, affecting over 34 million Americans and placing an estimated $327 billion annual burden on the healthcare system. The disease reduces life expectancy and quality of life while contributing to severe complications including heart disease, kidney failure, vision loss, and amputations. A significant challenge in diabetes management is underdiagnosis - 1 in 5 diabetics and 8 in 10 prediabetics are unaware of their condition. Therefore, early identification of at-risk individuals enables lifestyle modification and preventive care, potentially mitigating the burden of diabetes. We aim to discover in this study the relevant risk factors of diabetes to better understand predictive factors of diabetes. 
The CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) provides extensive data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and preventive care practices across the United States. Leveraging the cleaned 2015 BRFSS dataset, this project will: (1) identify key demographic, behavioral, and clinical factors associated with diabetes, (2) build predictive models to identify at-risk individuals, and (3) evaluate whether a reduced subset of survey questions can maintain predictive accuracy. By integrating statistical and machine learning approaches,we aim to support the development of accessible, cost-effective screening tools for early diabetes detection. 
This work has the potential to support the development of accessible, cost-effective tools for early diabetes detection and prevention in large populations, enabling population-level screening and earlier intervention among high-risk individuals. 


# Intended Final Products

**Introduction page**: Overview of diabetes and study motivation, summary of the BRFSS dataset, and key variables used in the analysis. This page will introduce the research goals and data structure.

**Statistical analysis page**: Description of the statistical methods, including logistic regression, subgroup and interaction analyses, and predictive modeling. This section will summarize key results such as adjusted odds ratios, ROC curves, and model diagnostics.

**Visualizations page**: Interactive plots and charts showing the distribution of metabolic, behavioral, and demographic factors across diabetes groups. This will include histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps, and subgroup comparisons.
Final report: A concise written summary of findings, interpretation of results, sensitivity checks, and public health implications related to metabolic and lifestyle risk factors for diabetes.	

# Data Description and Sources

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset) is from BRFSS, an annual health-related telephone survey collected by CDC. This data is from the survey in 2015 that was collected from 441,455 Americans. The original dataset has 330 variables covering medical, behavioral, and demographic indicators. Variables that are either directly from the responses of participants or calculated from their responses.   
**Target Variable**:
Diabetes_binary: indicates diabetes presence (1 = prediabetes or diabetes, 0 = no diabetes).
**Feature Variables**:
Medical: HighBP (High Blood Pressure), HighChol (High Cholesterol), BMI
Behavioral: Smoker (at least 100 cigarettes in entire life), Fruits (Consume Fruit >=1 times per day), Veggies (Consume Vegetables >=1 times per day), HvyAlcoholConsump (male >=14 drinks/wk, female >=7 drinks/wk)
Demographic/Perception: Age, Income, Sex

# Planned Analyses/Visualizations

**I. Exploring the Relationship Between Health Indicators and Diabetes Status**

1.1 Distribution of Diabetes Status Across the Population
A bar chart will display the proportion of individuals with and without diabetes. 

1.2 Comparison of Key Health Indicators by Diabetes Status
Boxplots and violin plots will compare variables such as BMI, Age between diabetic and non-diabetic groups. 

1.3 Correlation Between Predictors
A heatmap of the Pearson correlation coefficients among numeric predictors (e.g., BMI, age) will help identify multicollinearity and relationships among variables that may influence regression modeling.

**II. Logistic Regression and Cross-sectional Analysis**

2.1 Baseline Logistic Regression Model
A binary logistic regression will be conducted with Diabetes_binary as the dependent variable and 10 selected features as predictors. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be visualized using a forest plot, highlighting which factors significantly increase or decrease the likelihood of diabetes.

2.2 Subgroup Analyses and Interaction Analyses
Separate logistic regressions will be run for subgroups based on sex, age group, and income level, which will be summarized in comparative bar charts to observe how the strength and direction of associations vary across demographic groups. Interaction terms (e.g., Age × BMI) will be tested to explore dependencies. 

**III. Prediction and Model Evaluation**

3.1 Model Performance and ROC Analysis
The predictive ability of the logistic regression model will be evaluated using ROC curves and AUC scores. Confusion matrices and precision-recall curves will also be plotted for additional insight.

3.2 Feature Importance Visualization
A horizontal bar chart of standardized coefficients or SHAP values will rank the predictors by their relative contribution to diabetes prediction, providing an interpretable summary of key risk factors.

# Coding Challenges

During the course of this project, we expect to encounter several technical and analytical challenges, such as efficiently processing the large BRFSS dataset, addressing missing values and class imbalance, and implementing robust predictive and feature selection models in R. Particular attention will be given to optimizing computational performance, validating model accuracy, and ensuring transparency and reproducibility through well-documented and reproducible workflows.
